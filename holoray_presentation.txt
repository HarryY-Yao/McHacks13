Who is our project for?
What problem are we solving?
Is it a real problem?
Are there other solutions to this problem which don't need our project?
Why would someone take our solution?

Presentation Notes
I. Holoray and Products
	A. If it isn't solving a problem what is the point?
	B. Python and Pytorch
	C. Medtech Company which started as a research company in the department of surgery. A lot of engineers. Our speaker is a software engineer.
		1. Cardiac Surgery (heart transplants damn).
		2. There is no effective method for teaching this sort of hands-on work.
			a. How do you teach someone to separate fat from anatomical structures?
			b. Rebuilt zoom, teams, etc. for healthcare providers.
				i. Admin tools and annotations.
				ii. This doesn't work for every healthcare provider.
			c. Augmented reality headsets to allow medicine practitioners to leave hands-free. Even if they are clicking buttons in mid-air it is really distracting (imagine in a surgery!)
				i. Remote collaboration.
				ii. There are a number of expensive machines in a hospital.
				iii. IOT hardware. Holopod. You need immediate access to information for doctors to give junior doctors advice.
				iv. Gives you access to tests and samples next to the live view of the surgery or other operation.
	D. Today's Challenge
		1. 2d Annotations. These Annotations stay fixed in their position. We want these annotations to move with the anatomy of the person.
		2. OpenCV in Python notebook is a recommendation.
		3. Key Considerations:
			a. Resistance to Drift
			b. Jitter
			c. Latency
			d. Out-of-Frame scenarios.
			e. Edge-case handling.
			f. Occlusion (what if something disapears off screen).
			g. Bonus: functional UI or WebRTC integration.
		4. Encouraging Vibe-coding.
